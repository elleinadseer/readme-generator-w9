## Description

I have been tasked to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Using NPM I have utilised inquirer to create answerable prompts and fs to connect to a separate file containing a template for the README that will be created using user answers.

## Development

This project was relatively straight forward as I was able to elaborate on work I had already created during the activities of my 9th module - my specific struggle was implementing the formatting for the writeFile and inquirer sections. I had to test a few different approaches for this to get the result I wanted, as a previous method I used successfully in my activities didn't seem to carry over correctly. Eventually I did arrive at the answer by observing the consistencies in the formatting presented in examples given in the activities.

## Credits

I have heavily relied on information taught through the module 9 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs. Some code was already pre-provided for our use.
